# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice using C++**.

I use this repository to:
- Build strong problem-solving skills
- Practice DSA concepts in a structured way
- Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming

---

## Topics Covered
- Arrays and Strings  
- Recursion  
- Sorting and Searching  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Trees and Binary Search Trees  
- Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy Algorithms  

---

## Approach
- Focus on clean and efficient C++ code
- Prefer clear logic over unnecessary complexity
- Practice problems from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and CodeChef
- Optimize solutions where required

---

## Tools & Language
- C++  
- VS Code  
- Git & GitHub  

---

This repository is regularly updated as I continue solving and learning DSA.
